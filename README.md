## <a name="Project">Project Direction</a>
I created this app to merge my two interests of coding and crypto trading. This allows you to quickly check the movements of your cryptocurrencies and I'm adding the functionality to click on a cryptocurrency card and get a graph showing the price movement over a given period and more detailed information about the crytpocurrency. I learned alot during the course of making this app including using Material-UI for repsonsive styling, API usage and passing props from one component to another.

## <a name="Install">Installation</a>
The deployed live app is [HERE](https://krypto-beta.netlify.app/)

* Or to clone the repo
```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:lroberts77/krypto-beta.git
$ cd Krypt
$ npm install
```

## <a name="Usage">Usage</a>
* In the root of the project
```shell
$ npm start
```
If a tab doesn't open with the Krypto-beta app running, open a new tab and type in http://localhost:3000 in the url bar and press enter. After the page has loaded scroll up and down to view the top 32 crytocurrencies. If you want to search for a currency type in the search box and it will filter the currencies to the value of the search box.

## <a name="Improvements">Improvements</a>
* Experiment more with styling
* 24 hour graph with more information about crypto when card is clicked
